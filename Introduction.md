# Introduction
## Purpose of this framework
The purpose of this framework is to outline a foundation of project best practices that should prepare you to successfully accomplish most efforts the organization will initiate. The philosophies, principles, and values, contained in this Framework are built upon a proven set of dynamic practices from the Project Management Institute (PMI), Agile, and Organizational Change communities.

## Roots of the Framework
The Framework Philosophy blends agile development philosophies and practices with standard Project Management Institute (PMI) project practices to create a framework in which results can be achieved in a dynamic yet controlled fashion. Business efforts will move forward in a standard yet dynamic way that produces product and service results which drive innovation with just the right amount of protocol and documentation.

## Philosophy
Using a standard approach to start, plan, communicate and implement initiatives will create an environment where staff at all levels focus on the Agency’s most important initiatives, achieve what they commit to doing, manage agency resources to complete initiatives with minimum confusion, and consistently deliver value to executives, staff, and stakeholders time-after-time. 

To develop and realize a consistent philosophy for completing work, the following mind-set should guide your project activities:
* Relate projects to the mission and strategic purpose of the agency.
* Focus on early delivery of usable benefit to the business. Deliver a minimum working product as quickly as possible. 
* Allow solutions to develop as a deeper understanding of the solution evolves. Facilitate changes that focus on business value.  
* Deliver, “fit-for-purpose” solutions with the agreed upon priorities, within the agreed upon time-frames.
* Ensure efforts are resoruced with people and tools to complete the work.
* Use an agreed upon framwork and supplement the effort with good management and leadership practices to run effective projects.

The philosophy is focused on four critical areas that give the project operational value:
* __Executing Strategy__: Executing Strategy: Focus on the most important initiatives because resources are limited and it facilitates throughput.
* __Accountability__:	Do what we said we would do, when we said we would do it to meet customer requirements.  
* __Results__:	Consistently demonstrate and deliver value to executives, staff, and stakeholders over time.  
* __Resource Management__:	Manage agency resources to complete our initiatives with the highest efficiency and effectiveness.

This philosophy coalesces with the project principles described below. 

## Principles
Thre are six principles in this framework to guide you and your team’s behavior:
* Principle 1. __Focus on the Customer and Program__: Business is the focus of every project proposal, analysis, decision, and action. Every project taken should move the program toward achieving its strategic goals and satisfying  customer requirements. That means focusing resources and activities on achieving the program priority, scope, schedule, budget, and quality requirements to deliver value now and in the future.

* Principle 2. __Collaborate for Results__: When a team works in a spirit of collaboration and commitment, they will produce more deliverables with higher quality than groups that do not have a good understanding and shared ownership of the final product. 

* Principle 3. __Evolve Incrementally__: This principle encourages building and delivering a useful business solution incrementally. Building incrementally allows collaborative development and delivers business value early which increases stakeholder confidence. The project team should understand the business problem, the problem scope, and the proposed solution. Gather enough detail to start quickly and deliver a serviceable increment of a solution that addresses the problem. 

* Principle 4. __Deliver with Quality__: Gain agreement on quality, there should not be, “gold plating.” The solution should, “adequately meet the minimum business requirements” and be “fit-for-service”. Quality is a delivery constraint the Business Sponsors and Project Manager should agree upon when the Project Requirements are being discussed. 

* Principle 5. __Communicate Clearly__: This principle emphasizes the value of human interaction over documentation. The interactions can be carried out in standup sessions, facilitated workshops, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and personal conversations to resolve conflict. Communication is one of the most important aspects of project success or failure.  

* Principle 6. __Demonstrate Control__: Project Managers and Teams should be in control of the project at all times. This requires proactive monitoring and controlling progress to ensure it is consistent with the project objecives. by gathering information, presenting progress reports, actively using change control, and understanding the business case.
